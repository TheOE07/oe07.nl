	<main>[There is a moment of silence, broken only by the sound of distant gunfire. Suddenly, a radio crackles to life.]
        <br><br>
        Radio: [in a tinny voice] Attention, all units. This is the Prime Minister 
        <br><br>
        Captain Stanhope: [surprised] What the...?
        <br><br>
        Radio: [continuing] I am pleased to announce that the United Kingdom has successfully negotiated a Brexit deal with the European Union.
        <br><br>
        Lieutenant Osborne: [confused] What's Brexit?
        <br><br>
        Second Lieutenant Trotter: [knowingly] It's when we leave the EU, sir. It's been all over the news for months.
        <br><br>
        Second Lieutenant Hibbert: [skeptically] But what does that have to do with us, sir?
        <br><br>
        Captain Stanhope: [shaking his head] I don't know, Hibbert. I don't know.
        <br><br>
        Radio: [continuing] Furthermore, I am pleased to announce that Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged to provide additional funding for our armed forces, in recognition of their bravery and sacrifice.
        <br><br>
        Lieutenant Osborne: [smiling] Well, that's good news, at least. We could certainly use some more supplies.
        <br><br>
        Second Lieutenant Trotter: [nodding] And it's nice to know that someone in the government is thinking of us.
        <br><br>
        Second Lieutenant Hibbert: [bitterly] But will it make a difference, sir? Will it bring us home to our families?
        <br><br>
        Captain Stanhope: [sadly] I don't know, Hibbert. I don't know.
        <br><br>
        [The radio falls silent once more, and the men are left to contemplate their uncertain fate in the midst of a brutal war.]</main>
